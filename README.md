# Chester for Discord

Chester, previously known as CatBot, is an incredibly simple Discord bot.  You send it the command '+meow' and it returns a random joke about cats.  That's it.

## Using the public bot

If you want to invite Chester to your existing server, just point your browser at https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=686054770141692080&scope=bot&permissions=2147503104 .

## Usage

In the Discord server running Chester, type:

```
+meow
```

A random cat joke will be returned to the channel.


## Support

[Report an issue](https://github.com/nonbinarycoding/) if you have problems.


## Notes

The jokes were copied into a text file from https://bestlifeonline.com/cat-jokes/ 
in case you're wondering where they came from.  I did not write them myself.  Feel free to send me more jokes.
